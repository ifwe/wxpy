wxList<T> may be a template type, but it is declared with a weird macro, and I
couldn't get it to play nice with SIP's template MappedType support.

So instead, genlisttypes.py in the root directory creates files based on
list.sip.template (also in the root directory) and places the files in this
directory.

A file called "lists.sip" is also generated, including each of the generated
files here.
